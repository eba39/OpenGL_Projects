# ShapesAndViews
This scene shows off basic shape creation without textures.
Every shape is generated except for the cube and the pyramid. 
The focus in this project was primarly on generating the sphere's vertices. (sphere.cpp, sphere.h) It took a while, but it was worth it when I finally got it working!
