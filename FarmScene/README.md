# FarmScene
This is a scene I created for my final project in my first OpenGL course!

## You can download and try the working release version here: [download link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eAvTTp2BYIRAOoVMX8xABhGOaPHwXK3E/view?usp=sharing) ##

To run this project after building all dll, image, and shader files must be in the same directory as the exe.
No image files or dll's will be provided here, but you can still download the released version above.

### Build dependencies:
freeglut 
GLEW 2.1.0
DevIL 1.8.0 SDK for Windows
GLM - OpenGL Mathematics
